# Star_Fox64_Unity

## This is a short demo that I made, during my first semester of my computer science major, as a way to learn how to use Unity
## As such, this project is poorly designed and doesn't follow most basic good coding practices.
## This should not be taken as a representation of my current skill. It's just a fun look back on where it began for me.
